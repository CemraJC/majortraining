### What is this?

The "[Mnemonic major system](https://en.wikipedia.org/Mnemonic_major_system)" - hereafter referred to as 'the major system' - is best defined as:
> **"a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers"**
> ~ Wikipedia _2014_

Numbers on their own are cold and emotionless. This makes them rather difficult to remember accurately. By converting these faceless numbers into consonant sounds, a sequence of numbers can be turned into words by adding vowels between them.

This website's main goal is simple: **To provide a platform for practicing the major system**

#### _How effective is this system?_
Quick sidenote on the reasons why you should learn the major system as soon as you can:

* ***Speed.*** The best reason to use your memory is that it's always with you and it's faster than paper.
* The ability to remember useful numbers (credit card number, phone numbers, social security number)
* Quick math. You can remember results of previous calculations.
* Remembering things associated with numbers (What's the 47th element on the periodic table?)
* Not always requiring sequential memory techniques (many of these exist)

Many people are known to use the major system. Most of these people are stage performers who enact "magical" feats assisted greatly by their memory. In many memory competitions, this system is used. There are countless other aplications (surprisingly, not all of them legal).

### How do I use it?

First, I would reccommend doing a bit of research on the major system. Once you know what it is, the website will make much more sense to you.

#### Stage 1
Once you're familiar with the system, practice converting numbers into words. Start on level 1 (2 digit numbers). You should only progress to the next level when you are able to generate words faster than you can type them. It's okay to use the same word more than once (on level 1).

**Important:** Each level has it's own 'progression state' - i.e. when the computer thinks you're fast enough to progress to the next level. Also, **make sure you read the level's constraints** because sometimes, you won't be able to use a particular word, generate only a single word, generate two words - etc.

Your score depends on how many words you generate correctly and how quickly you can generate them. Your current score is calculated based on the last ten words. Your highest score is stored locally (in your browser) and persists. High scores only apply to the level you're on.

#### Stage 2
The final step to learning the amjor system is converting words back in to numbers. Chances are, you can already do this pretty well, but if you need practice - here it is.


### Enjoy!

I made this training website for my own personal use. I then thought that it would be beneficial to share with others. I made it into a website because a webpage is far more shareable and cross-platform than a native program. I hope you enjoy using this site as much as I did making it.
