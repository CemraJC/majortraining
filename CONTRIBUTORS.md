## Todo

* Refactor the entire project. Yeah.
    - Needs to be integrated with gulp
    - Needs a separate gh-pages branch with only the generated site on it
    - Need to split up the (too big) main.js file
    - Need a better init routine

* Update the UI
    - Currently, everything looks super amature...
        + Better buttons
        + AIO slider panel with hamburger menu
        + Better title graphic
        + Glyphs next to important links
    - Better colour scheme needed.
    - Better branding (logo) required
    - Add button to prompt for database download
    - Upgrade the learning assistant

* Logical improvements
    - Allow for offline use WITHOUT running a local server
    - Actually make the database work.
        + THEN we can make stage 2
    - Add a timer
    - Add a disclaimer about how scores are calculated
    - Make sure the user knows that their progress should be auto saved.
    - Implement a service worker? 0.o
