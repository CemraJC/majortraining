## Todo

* Update the UI
    + Glyphs next to important links

* Logical improvements
    - make stage 2
    - dictionary filtering (remove words with weird letters)
        - add a function that returns true / false if a word matches all requirements? Use Regex?
    - Add a timer
    - Add a disclaimer about how scores are calculated
    - Make sure the user knows that their progress should be auto saved. (Add a welcome modal??)
